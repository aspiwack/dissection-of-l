abstract = {U. Berger, [11] significantly simplified Tait’s normalisation proof for bar recursion [27], see also [9], replacing Tait’s introduction of infinite terms by the construction of a domain having the property that a term is strongly normalizing if its semantics is. The goal of this paper is to show that, using ideas from the theory of intersection types [2, 6, 7, 21] and Martin-L\"{o}f’s domain interpretation of type theory [18], we can in turn simplify U. Berger’s argument in the construction of such a domain model. We think that our domain model can be used to give modular proofs of strong normalization for various type theory. As an example, we show in some details how it can be used to prove strong normalization for Martin-L\"{o}f dependent type theory extended with bar recursion, and with some form of proof-irrelevance. 1},

abstract = {One way to model a sound and complete translation from a source calculus into a target calculus is with an adjoint or a Galois connection. In the special case of a reflection, one also has that the target calculus is isomorphic to a subset of the source. We show that three widely studied translations form reflections. We use as our source language Moggi's computational lambda calculus, which is an extension of Plotkin's call-by-value calculus. We show that Plotkin's CPS translation, Moggi's monad translation, and Girard's translation to linear logic can all be regarded as reflections form this source language, and we put forward the computational lambda calculus as a model of call-by-value computation that improves on the traditional call-by-value calculus. Our work strengthens Plotkin's and Moggi's original results and improves on recent work based on equational correspondence, which uses equations rather than reductions.},

@phdthesis{McKinna92,
abstract = {This thesis considers the problem of program correctness within a rich theory of dependent types, the Extended Calculus of Constructions (ECC). This system contains a powerful programming language of higher-order primitive recursion and higher-order intuitionistic logic. It is supported by Pollack's versatile LEGO implementation, which I use extensively to develop the mathematical constructions studied here. I systematically investigate Burstall's notion of deliverable, that is, a program paired with a proof of correctness. This approach separates the concerns of programming and logic, since I want a simple program extraction mechanism. The Sigma-types of the calculus enable us to achieve this. There are many similarities with the subset interpretation of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. I show that deliverables have a rich categorical structure, so that correctness proofs may be decomposed in a principled way. The categorical combinators which I define in the system package up much logical book-keeping, allowing one to concentrate on the essential structure of algorithms. I demonstrate our methodology with a number of small examples, culminating in a machine-checked proof of the Chinese remainder theorem, showing the utility of the deliverables idea. Some drawbacks are also encountered. I consider also semantic aspects of deliverables, examining the definitions in an abstract setting, again firmly based on category theory. The aim is to overcome the clumsiness of the language of categorical combinators, using dependent type theories and their interpretation in fibrations. I elaborate a concrete instance based on the category of sets, which generalises to an arbitrary topos. In the process, I uncover a subsystem of ECC within which one may speak of deliverables defined over the topos. In the presence of enough extra structure, the interpretation extends to the whole of ECC. The wheel turns full circle.},

Il offre une introduction \`{a} trois des th\'{e}ories \`{a} la racine des math\'{e}matiques et recouvre une bonne partie du cursus de L3 \`{a} l’Universit\'{e}. Les th\'{e}ories abord\'{e}es sont : - la th\'{e}orie des repr\'{e}sentations des groupes finis, qui est \`{a} la fois une extension naturelle de l’alg\`{e}bre lin\'{e}aire et une premi\`{e}re approche de la transform\'{e}e de Fourier, - l’analyse fonctionnelle classique (espaces de Banach et Hilbert, int\'{e}grale de Lebesgue, transform\'{e}e de Fourier), - la th\'{e}orie des fonctions holomorphes. Le cours est compl\'{e}t\'{e} par un chapitre « Vocabulaire Math\'{e}matique » (avec une soixantaine d’exercices corrig\'{e}s) qui regroupe et pr\'{e}cise des notions de base, vues en L1 et L2 ou pendant les classes pr\'{e}paratoires, et par 9 probl\`{e}mes corrig\'{e}s couvrant l’int\'{e}gralit\'{e} du programme. La principale originalit\'{e} de l’ouvrage vient de l’accent mis sur l’aspect culturel des math\'{e}matiques. De nombreuses notes de bas de page proposent de petites excursions en dehors de l’autoroute des math\'{e}matiques utiles. Six appendices pr\'{e}sentent des extraits de la litt\'{e}rature classique et moderne, accessibles avec le contenu du cours, qui illustrent l’unit\'{e} des math\'{e}matiques en montrant comment les th\'{e}ories de base se combinent pour la r\'{e}solution de probl\`{e}mes naturels profonds. L’un d’entre eux est consacr\'{e} au th\'{e}or\`{e}me des nombres premiers ; un autre est une introduction au programme de Langlands, qui occupe les arithm\'{e}ticiens depuis plus de 40 ans, et dont une des retomb\'{e}es les plus spectaculaires est la d\'{e}monstration du th\'{e}or\`{e}me de Fermat.},

« Scribble is a new system for writing library documentation, user guides, and tutorials. Scribble builds on PLT Scheme’s technology for language extension, and at its heart is a new approach to connecting prose references with library bindings. We have built Scribble libraries that support standalone documentation and papers, JavaDoc-style API documentation, and literate programming. Thanks in large part to Scribble’s flexibility and the ease with which we can cross-reference information across different levels, the documentation that is distributed with PLT Scheme now runs into the thousands of pages. This paper reports on the use of Scribble and on its design as both an extension and extensible part of PLT Scheme. »},

abstract = {We give an intuitionistic view of Seely's interpretation of Martin-L\"{o}f's intuitionistic type theory in locally cartesian closed categories. The idea is to use Martin-L\"{o}f type theory itself as metalanguage, and E-categories, the appropriate notion of categories when working in this metalanguage. As an E-categorical substitute for the formal system of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory we use E-categories with families (E-cwfs). These come in two flavours: groupoid-style E-cwfs and proof-irrelevant E-cwfs. We then analyze Seely's interpretation as consisting of three parts. The first part is purely categorical: the interpretation of groupoid-style E-cwfs in E-locally cartesian closed categories. (The key part of this interpretation has been type-checked in the Coq system.) The second is a coherence problem which relates groupoid-style E-cwfs with proof-irrelevant ones. The third is a purely syntactic problem: that proof-irrelevant E-cwfs are equivalent to traditional lambda calculus based formulations of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory.},

Significant speed-ups are achieved by compiling proof terms, see [9]. Since compilation erases some type information, we have to show that convertibility is preserved by type erasure. This article shows the equivalence of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (formalism of Coq) and its domain-free version where parameters of inductive types are also erased. It generalizes and strengthens significantly a similar result by Barthe and S\o rensen [5] on the class of functional Domain-free Pure Type Systems.},

abstract = {We study a complex type theory, a Calculus of Inductive Constructions with a predicative hierarchy of universes and a first-order theory T built in its conversion relation. The theory T is specified abstractly, by a set of constructors, a set of defined symbols, axioms expressing that constructors are free and defined symbols completely defined, and a generic elimination principle relying on crucial properties of first-order structures satisfying the axioms. We first show that CoqMTU enjoys all basic meta-theoretical properties of such calculi, confluence, subject reduction and strong normalization when restricted to weak-elimination, implying the decidability of type-checking in this case as well as consistency. The case of strong elimination is left open.},

abstract = {In a simply-typed, call-by-value (CBV) language with first-class continuations, the usual CBV fixpoint operator can be defined in terms of a simple, infinitely-looping iteration primitive. We first consider a natural but flawed definition, based on exceptions and iterative deepening of finite unfoldings, and point out some of its shortcomings. Then we present the proper construction using full first-class continuations, with both an informal derivation and a proof that the behavior of the defined operator faithfully mimics a built-in recursion primitive. In fact, given an additional uniformity assumption, the construction is a two-sided inverse of the usual definition of iteration from recursion. Continuing, we show that the CBV looping primitive is in fact the direct-style equivalent of a continuation-passing-style fixpoint, and that this correspondence extends all the way to traditional definitions of these operators in terms of reflexive types.},

The four main chapters present the basics: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature is the inclusion of many optional topics not usually part of a first course due to time constraints: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and Steenrod squares and powers.},

Combined with the evaluation functional, p→e yields an efficient normalization algorithm. The method is extended to $\lambda$-calculi with constants and is used to normalize (the $\lambda$-representations of) natural deduction proofs of (higher order) arithmetic. A consequence of theoretical interest is a strong completeness theorem for $\beta$$\eta$-reduction. If two $\lambda$-terms have the same value in some model containing representations of the primitive recursive functions (of level 1) then they are probably equal in the $\beta$$\eta$-calculus},

abstract = {In this paper we develop an axiomatic setup for algorithmic homological algebra of Abelian categories. This is done by exhibiting all existential quantifiers entering the definition of an Abelian category, which for the sake of computability need to be turned into constructive ones. We do this explicitly for the often-studied example Abelian category of finitely presented modules over a so-called computable ring R, i.e., a ring with an explicit algorithm to solve one-sided (in)homogeneous linear systems over R. For a finitely generated maximal ideal m in a commutative ring R we show how solving (in)homogeneous linear systems over R\_m can be reduced to solving associated systems over R. Hence, the computability of R implies that of R\_m. As a corollary we obtain the computability of the category of finitely presented R\_m-modules as an Abelian category, without the need of a Mora-like algorithm. The reduction also yields, as a by-product, a complexity estimation for the ideal membership problem over local polynomial rings. Finally, in the case of localized polynomial rings we demonstrate the computational advantage of our homologically motivated alternative approach in comparison to an existing implementation of Mora's algorithm.},

abstract = {Most books on data structures assume an imperative language such as C or C++. However, data structures for these languages do not always translate well to functional languages such as Standard ML, Haskell, or Scheme. This book describes data structures from the point of view of functional languages, with examples, and presents design techniques that allow programmers to develop their own functional data structures. The author includes both classical data structures, such as red-black trees and binomial queues, and a host of new data structures developed exclusively for functional languages. All source code is given in Standard ML and Haskell, and most of the programs are easily adaptable to other functional languages. This handy reference for professional programmers working with functional languages can also be used as a tutorial or for self-study.},

@misc{Kiselyov,
abstract = {. We propose type systems that abstractly interpret small-step rather than big-step operational semantics. We treat an expression or evaluation context as a structure in a linear logic with hypothetical reasoning. Evaluation order is not only regulated by familiar focusing rules in the operational semantics, but also expressed by structural rules in the type system, so the types track control flow more closely. Binding and evaluation contexts are related, but the latter are linear. We use these ideas to build a type system for delimited continuations. It lets control operators change the answer type or act beyond the nearest dynamically-enclosing delimiter, yet needs no extra fields in judgments and arrow types to record answer types. The typing derivation of a directstyle program desugars it into continuation-passing style. 1},

abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

abstract = {. We introduce Erasure Pure Type Systems, anextensionto Pure Type Systems with an erasure semantics centered around a type constructor ∀ indicating parametric polymorphism. The erasure phase is guided by lightweight program annotations. The typing rules guarantee that well-typed programs obey a phase distinction between erasable (compile-time) and non-erasable (run-time) terms. The erasability of an expression depends only on how its value is used in the rest of the program. Despite this simple observation, most languages treat erasability as an intrinsic property of expressions, leading to code duplication problems. Our approach overcomes this deficiency by treating erasability extrinsically. Because the execution model of EPTS generalizes the familiar notions of type erasure and parametric polymorphism, we believe functional programmers will find it quite natural to program in such a setting. 1},

abstract = {In this paper we develop the theory of quasispaces (for a Grothendieck topology) and of concrete quasitopoi, over a suitable base category. We introduce the notion of f-regular category and of f-regular functor. The f-regular categories are regular categories in which every family with a common codomain can be factorized into a strict epimorphic family followed by a (single) monomorphism. The f-regular functors are (essentially) functors that preserve finite strict monomorphic and arbitrary strict epimorphic families. These two concepts furnish the context to develop the constructions of the theory of concrete quasitopoi over a suitable base category, which is a theory of pointed quasitopoi. Our results on quasispaces and quasitopoi, or closely related ones, were already established by Penon, but we prove them here with different assumptions and generality, and under a completely different light.},

As part of the development, we extend Meyer and Wand's characterization of the relationship between continuation-passing and direct style to one for continuation-passing vs. general "monadic" style. We further show that the composablecontinuations construct can itself be represented using ordinary, non-composable first-class continuations and a single piece of state. Thus, in the presence of two specific computational effects -- storage and escapes -- any expressible monadic structure (e.g., nondeterminism as represented by the list monad) can be added as a purely definitional extension, without requiring a reinterpretation of the whole language. The paper includes an implementation of the construction (in Standard ML with some New Jersey extensions) and several examples. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and o...},

@article{Hancock,
abstract = {A pattern of interaction that arises again and again in programming is a "handshake", in which two agents exchange data. The exchange is thought of as provision of a service. Each interaction is initiated by a specific agent--the client or Angel--and concluded by the other--the server or Demon. We present a category in which the objects--called interaction structures in the paper--serve as descriptions of services provided across such handshaken interfaces. The morphisms--called (general) simulations--model components that provide one such service, relying on another. The morphisms are relations between the underlying sets of the interaction structures. The proof that a relation is a simulation can serve (in principle) as an executable program, whose specification is that it provides the service described by its domain, given an implementation of the service described by its codomain. This category is then shown to coincide with the subcategory of "generated" basic topologies in Sambin's terminology, where a basic topology is given by a closure operator whose induced sup-lattice structure need not be distributive; and moreover, this operator is inductively generated from a basic cover relation. This coincidence provides topologists with a natural source of examples for non-distributive formal topology. It raises a number of questions of interest both for formal topology and programming. The extra structure needed to make such a basic topology into a real formal topology is then interpreted in the context of interaction structures.},

A trait is a collection of methods, i.e., behaviors without state; it can be viewed as an “incomplete stateless class” i.e., an interface with some already written behavior. Traits can be composed in any order, but only make sense when “imported” by a class that provides state variables and additional methods to disambiguate conflicting names arising between the imported traits. We introduce FeatherTrait Java with Interfaces (iFTJ), where traits need to be typechecked only once, which is necessary for compiling them in isolation, and considering them as regular types, like Java-interfaces with a behavioral content.},

@article{Heunen2009,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to relate algebraic quantum mechanics to topos theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces. Motivated by Bohr's idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from S(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized) truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).},

abstract = {In the context of statically typed, class-based languages, we investigate classes that can be extended with trait composition. A trait is a collection of methods without state; it can be viewed as an incomplete stateless class. Traits can be composed in any order, but only make sense when imported by a class that provides state variables and additional methods to disambiguate conflicting names arising between the imported traits. We introduce FeatherTrait Java (FTJ), a conservative extension of the simple lightweight class-based calculus Featherweight Java (FJ) with statically typed traits. In FTJ, classes can be built using traits as basic behavioral bricks; method conflicts between imported traits must be resolved explicitly by the user either by (i) aliasing or excluding method names in traits, or by (ii) overriding explicitly the conflicting methods in the class or in the trait itself. We present an operational semantics with a lookup algorithm, and a sound type system that guarantees that evaluating a well-typed expression never yields a message-not-understood run-time error nor gets the interpreter stuck. We give examples of the increased expressive power of the trait-based inheritance model. The resulting calculus appears to be a good starting point for a rigorous mathematical analysis of typed class-based languages featuring trait-based inheritance.},

« Both monads and Lawvere theories provide characterisations of algebraic structure, with monads providing the more general characterisation. The authors provide an introduction to Lawvere theories, discusses their relationship to sets, and why monads became the more popular treatment.Then they tackle the application of the theory to the semantics of side effects, where they argue that the generality of monads allow them to characterise computational phenomena that are not to do with side effects such as partiality and continuations, and argue that Lawvere theories more cleanly characterise what side effects are.
